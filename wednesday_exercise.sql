-----  SUBQUERIES  ------------
-- Subqueries are queries that happen within another query

-- Ex. Which films have exactly 12 actors in them?

-- Step 1. Get the ID's of the movies that have 12 actors 
SELECT film_id
FROM film_actor 
GROUP BY film_id 
HAVING count(*) = 12;

SELECT film_id
FROM film_actor 
group by film_id 
HAVING count(*) = 12;

-- film_id

--529
--802
--34
--892
--414
--517

-- Step 2. Get rows from the film table that have films in the above list
SELECT *
FROM film 
WHERE film_id IN (
	529,
	802,
	34,
	892,
	414,
	517
);

-- Create a Subquery: Combine the two steps into one query. The query that you want to execute
-- first is the subquery. ** Subquery must return only 1 column **
--                      ** unless used in a FROM clause **
