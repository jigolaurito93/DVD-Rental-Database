# DVD-Rental-Database

For this project, I had to execute the following query:

1. List all customers who live in Texas (use JOINs)
2. List all payments of more than $7.00 with the customerâ€™s first and last name
3. Show all customer names who have made over $175 in payments (use
subqueries)
4. List all customers that live in Argentina (use the city table)
5. Show all the film categories with their count in descending order
6. What film had the most actors in it (show film info)?
7. Which actor has been in the least movies?
8. Which country has the most cities?
9. List the actors who have been in between 20 and 25 films.
